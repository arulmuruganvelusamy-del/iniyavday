  letter: `Iniya,

Valentine's Day often comes with expectations — big words, grand gestures, and labels that try to define what love should look like.

But when I think of you, I don't feel the need to define anything.
I just feel grateful.

Grateful for the way you entered my life quietly, without force.
Grateful for the strength you carry so naturally.
Grateful for the calm, motivation, and inspiration you bring into my world simply by being you.

I admire the way you handle your life — your responsibilities, your career, your dreams — all with a grace that never asks for applause. Watching you grow, lead, and still dream bigger reminds me how powerful steady strength can be.

You've supported me in ways I'll never take lightly. You believed in me during uncertain moments, stood beside me when things were heavy, and helped not because you had to — but because you cared. That kind of support leaves a mark. It changed me.

What I feel for you isn't rushed or loud. It's calm, grounded, and real.
It's respect mixed with attraction.
Admiration mixed with comfort.
I don't need to name it to know it matters.

I like who I am when I'm with you.
I feel more focused.
More motivated.
More alive.

I believe in myself.
I believe in you.
And I believe in the idea of growing — side by side — without pressure, without timelines, just with honesty and intention.

This Valentine's Day, I just want you to know this:
You matter to me.
Your presence matters to me.
And I'm grateful that it's you.

Always yours, in my own way,
Arul`,
